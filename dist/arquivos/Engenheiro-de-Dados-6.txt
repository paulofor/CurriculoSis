For more information about our offices and culture, check out our Carta careers page.

The Problems You'll Solve

At Carta, Our Employees Set Out On a Mission To Unlock The Power Of Equity Ownership For More People In More Places. We Believe That The Problems We Solve Today Unlock The Opportunities Of Tomorrow. As a Senior Software Engineer, You’ll Work To

Here are some problems we need you to help us solve:

Carta’s developers work in distinct codebases that have their own architecture and logic: how do we build impactful solutions across these repos while maintaining consistency and efficiency?
If we think about the software development lifecycle as a continuous transaction, where are the optimal starting points to introduce standardized processes and supported workflows to reduce complexity and friction in development?
How can we proactively remove customer toil ahead of it being a blocker for developers? 

In This Role You Will

Architect, design and code highly available, secure, and scalable managed solutions like PaaS and IaaS
Drive the implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automating build, test, and deployment processes to accelerate software delivery 
Direct developers on how to leverage monitoring, alerting, and logging of the Platform to improve observability
Continuously evaluate and improve the developer experience by gathering feedback, measuring key metrics, and iterating on solutions to address emerging needs and challenges.
Mentor and grow junior software engineers

The Team You'll Work With

You will join our Developer Experience (DevEx) team of software engineers and infrastructure gurus within our Platform organization. Our North Star is to remove friction and toil during the software development lifecycle for our internal developers so that they can do the best work of their career.

We deliver an end-to-end developer experience that is customer-focused, data-driven, and predictable. We do this by increasing development velocity through automation, eliminating friction via paved roads, providing customized recommendations across the organization, and allowing product engineers to specify intent declaratively, decoupled from implementation details.

We work backwards from our customer’s needs and iterate quickly based on their feedback. Sitting at the nexus between our developers and our backend systems, DevEx is in a unique position to collect customer feedback and help shape strategy and direction for Platform teams as a whole.

About You

At Carta, you’re not just an employee. You’re a builder who is creating the infrastructure and tooling that accelerates innovation and empowers more ownership. Cartans are helpful, relentless, unconventional and kind; representing Carta’s Identity Traits. They work collaboratively and cross functionally to challenge the status quo; working towards a common goal of creating more owners in the private markets.

4+ years of relevant industry experience recommended
Years of experience - refer to Carta’s global leveling guidelines
Strong engineering practices (e.g. coding, unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)
Customer-centric. You’ll be working to simplify solutions and communicate them with your internal stakeholders regularly
Experience developing backend services
Experience with Python or Java
Experience leading, growing and mentoring other engineers

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, please connect with the recruiter via email. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.
