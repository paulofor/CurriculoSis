Machine Learning Engineer @ Bain
We are looking for a new Machine Learning Engineer to join our team in Brazil, to work in advanced analytics projects for our clients, in our factory team and/or in our own R&D team. For us, a Machine Learning Engineer is someone who has a broad knowledge of all the lifecycle of a Machine Learning project. We don’t expect you to necessarily have the deep mathematical knowledge a Data Scientist has. Nor being able to write a whole web application by yourself, as a Software Engineer does. But, you must feel very comfortable navigating between both worlds.
As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will play a fundamental role on technical decision making, embedded in projects and working with clients of different industries. You will also get your hands dirty writing code to get Machine Learning models working at real world production environments. This role teams up closely with Data Scientists, Impact Leaders, Consultants and Team Leaders to boost, deepen and streamline the development of innovative solutions that respond to high complexity problems.
What we expect from you?
Strong theoretical background on machine learning, ideally practical experience on building and deploying machine learning models.
Write code in Python, embracing good code practices.
Being able to deal with different tasks during the whole Machine Learning life cycle. What kind of tasks? ML model deployment and maintenance, building and using tools for ML monitoring, CI/CD pipeline design, supporting experimentation with ML models, designing and building data pipelines, among others.
You have experience working with cloud infrastructure.
You are familiar with the lifecycle of a Machine Learning model.
You are familiar with Containers.
You can build a service that exposes a ML Learning model to be consumed by other applications.
You love teaching others and sharing good practices.
You like getting your hands dirty with new tools and languages. Sometimes it is better to take a risk and learn something new, rather than choosing the good old hammer you always use. It doesn’t matter if you take more time, it is an investment for the future.
You like being versatile. You get bored when every day looks the same, so you like sometimes getting dressed as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer or Software Engineer.
Constant collaboration with your teammates.
Provide and accept frequent feedback.
Be autonomous within a collaborative environment.
Find the best and unique version of yourself and boost it!
You have 2 or more years of experience and/or a relevant graduate degree.
What can you expect working with us?
At the beginning
A big welcome!
Start with one of our clients in a project that has a clear scope and timeline.
Immediately become part of our diverse human ecosystem.
Become familiar with our tools and methodologies.
You will have a buddy who will support you in everything related with your entry.

During your first case
Start with one of our clients in a project that has a clear scope and timeline.
Be exposed to the inner-workings of a company and challenges.
Interaction! You will have to relate with team mates as well as with clients in a dynamic style.
Deploy a model into production that will directly impact reality.
Start your PD plan inside AAG.
You will receive continuous feedback from your team and leadership.
In between cases

Cool down and recover energies for next project.
Document knowledge for the internal and external community.
Join our R&D Lab and help us put into practice state-of-the-art and recently published AI papers.
Write an article to publish on our engineering Medium.
During your second case
You will tackle a second problem, ideally different from your last project.
As long as you learn new techniques, the complexity of your proposed solutions will grow.
You will start walking ahead in your PD with your advisor.
And from there
You will be staffed to different projects in different industries.
You will share with your colleagues your success and your failures.
You will strengthen your critical thinking and be able to propose suitable solutions for each challenge.
You will have the space to explore topics of your interest and write articles to consolidate your knowledge and share it with your colleagues.
You will have space to work in pro-bono projects.
Benefits
Apple equipment.
Maternity and Paternity leave: birth and non-birth parents will be eligible to receive 26 weeks* of paid leave.
